# Deep Learning

This repository contains some of my deep learning projects. 

## 1. Real-time Object Detection
This project is based on Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. It uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) model with TensorFlow and Keras to detect cars on street. To optimize the model, I also filtered images with a threshold on class scores and utilized non-max suppression (NMS) to futher correct the object location.
